# About the project
This project aims to send me updates twice a day in a personal Telegram group informing the current quotation of the currency pair US Dolar/Brazilian Real. It solves a personal problem that I had, look everytime in financial websites to know the pair price and take decisions for when to buy US Dolar. Now I receive notifications in my phone and don't need to worry about.
